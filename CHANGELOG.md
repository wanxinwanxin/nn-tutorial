## Release Notes

### Version 0.3.0 Highlights
ðŸŽ‰ **Chapter 2 Complete!** The Neural Network Tutorial now has two fully-functional chapters covering the foundational concepts of neurons and activation functions. Users can interact with ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh functions through comprehensive Python examples and visualizations.

### Version 0.2.0 Highlights  
ðŸŽ¨ **Major UI Overhaul!** Introduced resizable panels that let users customize their learning experience. The new layout includes drag-to-resize functionality and fullscreen plot viewing, making it much easier to focus on different aspects of the tutorial.

### Version 0.1.0 Highlights
ðŸš€ **Foundation Laid!** Successfully created a browser-based Python execution environment with Pyodide, enabling real-time code editing and visualization without requiring any server setup.
